            <p class="post-text">When I say the word trade, I think of ancient history when people didn’t have a monetary system. Before people started using currency, they got through life bartering or trading things with each other. Two people would meet and have some kind of negotiation. After some initial back and forth, they would both agree that each had something that the other wanted and to do an exchange in order to better the lives of both parties. And that’s it right? End of story? Well, not in our league.</p>

            <p class="post-text">In our league, and in a majority of all Yahoo! leagues, when two people make a trade it goes through a 3 day waiting period. During this time, the league has the opportunity to vote to veto the trade and if one-third of the league decides to do so for whatever reason, then the trade doesn’t go through.
            </p>

            <p class="post-text">This feature was originally designed to provide a more democratic option than to merely let the commissioner decide to whether or not to veto the trade. The former wasn’t a popular option, because nobody could stop the commissioner from partaking in collusive transactions. We had to protect ourselves from this kind of cheating. Because let’s face it. People are always trying to game the system. For as long as humans have tried to design the system, there’s always been that jackass trying to game it.
            </p>

            <p class="post-text">But that’s exactly the problem. People always try to break the system. The veto button was supposed to be the anti-cheating mechanism. It was supposed to prevent the occurrence of an unfair trade. And for a while it worked. For a while it functioned exactly as how the head honchos over at Yahoo! thought it would. But people do what they always do, and they tried to game the system.
            </p>


            <p class="post-text">It started off slow, people just tested the waters at first. You’d see a trade get made, a trade you weren’t particularly fond of. Was the trade an outright example of collusion? Maybe it wasn’t, but maybe it was. You weren’t completely sure one way or the other, but you’d have the safety of at least four other managers being on the same side if the trade was vetoed. If the trade went through however, then no harm done, no foul. Nobody would even know that you’d cast a vote, because the whole veto system is fucking anonymous.
            </p>

            <p class="post-text">This happens for a couple trades and you realize that you can secretly pursue your own personal interest with little to no repercussions.
            </p>

            <p class="post-text">Suddenly, it’s not enough to just cast your vote blindly and hope for the best. You get curious about whether or not this trade will get vetoed or not. You pick up the phone and call some of the other managers. You casually bring up the pending trade in question and try to get a sense of whether or not they agree with your side of things. After about half an hour on the phone with different managers you’re confident that there are enough numbers to get the trade vetoed. You can finally relax. You know what’s going to happen and you can plan your next move.
            </p>

            <p class="post-text">Except it doesn’t just end there does it? After a while you realize that you’re contacting the same group of managers after every single trade is announced. It’s not really an alliance per se, it’s just a group of people who have similar opinions about the whether or not a trade should be vetoed. Whatever the decision is, it’s a decision that’s made together as a group, because no one is courageous enough to take a stand on an individual opinion that opposes the group. To veto or not to veto. These people knows basketball, I trust this group.
            </p>

            <p class="post-text">Then one day you get a call, the person on the other end of the line says they fucked up. He made a trade and needs it vetoed. There’s no evidence of collusion, but in order to make the playoffs he needs to reverse this move. He was there for you when you needed your trades to go through and when you wanted certain transactions to be blocked. Now he’s coming to you, asking for help. It goes without saying that regardless of what you decide, the phone call never happened, and nothing can ever get traced back to him. You put your phone down and have to decide what to do. But deep down inside, you know that he had your back then and now you have to have his.
            </p>

            <p class="post-text">Now you’re bound to each other by all this undercover snake scum shit that you’ve done together. It started out so innocently, but now there is so much pressure to continue on this path, because you can never go back. And the rest of the league can never find out that you were ever involved with this in the first place.
            </p>

            <p class="post-text">It’s a slippery slope, but at the end of the day people will be people. People try to break the system.
            </p>

            <p class="post-text">Is this considered cheating or an additional layer to the game? Is it right to enforce restrictions on how a manager is able to use his or her right to veto? Or are alliances a new layer to the game that all players have to accept? How would you maintain order in your league? How do you prevent people from trying to cheat or break the system? Is it cheating when every player had an equal opportunity to make the same moves?
