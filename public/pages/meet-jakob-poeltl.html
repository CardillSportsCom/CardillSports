			<p class="post-text">The Toronto Raptors are coming off a historic season which saw them win a team record of 56 games and reach the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time in the franchise’s 21 years. As an amazing season it was, with great achievements come even greater expectations for the next one as the Raps look to push to see championship glory. With that mentality you can understand why Masai was keeping his phone busy on draft day. According to many sources, Masai did have talks with multiple teams regarding the Raptors’ 9th pick, including a deal with OKC involving star PF Serge Ibaka. Unfortunately to the dismay of raps fans, things didn’t pan out in order to add some immediate production to the roster. So with no viable offers for the pick, the Raptors selected Austrian Native Jakob Poeltl PF/C out of the University of Utah. </p>    

            <h2 class="post-text">What you need to Know</h2>

            <p class="post-text">Standing 7’1’’ and 240 lbs., Poeltl is as big as basketball centers come. With great length and mobile feet he doesn’t move like your traditional center. His ability to run the floor on transition coupled with efficient big man scoring has given him the reputation of a solid prospect that is NBA ready. Here’s the quick rundown on Poeltl:</p>

            <ul class="post-text">   
                <li>Projected top 5-10 pick</li>
                <li>PAC 12 player of the year (15-16)</li>
                <li>Recipient of the Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Award and Pete Newell Big Man Award as the top collegiate center and low-post player</li>
                <li>Averaged 17.2 pts, 9.1 rbd, 1.6 blks on .646 FG in his sophomore/final year</li>
                <li>Strengths: Mobile big man, efficient scoring, strong rebounding</li>
                <li>Weaknesses: Big man strength, limited versatility</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="post-text" >Final Say</h2>

            <p class="post-text">  The Raps should be in a win now mindset as they look to build off last season. If they want to take their team to the next level they need a player that can help them now and address their weakness at the 4. When analyzing their success, the big reason they went so far was due to their depth. Cory Jo, Patrick Patterson, Bismack Biyombo all played vital roles in their memorable post season run. Biyombo, who is likely to sign elsewhere considering he has a big payday coming his way, was someone who brought much needed rebounding and rim protection as a reliable backup. I’ve read comments and articles around the web wondering if Poeltl will be able to fill those shoes as a reserve? Can he play the 4? Stretch the floor? But we have to understand Bismack was truly a diamond in the rough. Poeltl looks to have great fundamentals and basketball IQ. He has the size and mobility to become a solid defender and post player and sources say he’s even trying to develop an outside shot. In a league that’s getting smaller, a 7 foot PF may not be the best idea, but there is the obvious potential to provide the needed depth at the 5.  Depth is what’s going to continue our winning ways in Toronto. Watching highlights and interviews, Poeltl seems like he’s got a good head on his shoulders and has the talent to have a lasting career in the NBA.</p>
