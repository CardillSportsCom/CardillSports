			<p class="post-text">Near the end of the 2015 MLB season, Toronto Blue Jays received a blessing in disguise. With Marcus Stromam's miraculous return back into the Blue Jays starting rotation just months after tearing his ACL, he made a sudden impact for the Toronto Blue Jays' push to the post season . With his sudden return, he electrified the Jays rotation with countless strikeouts and with his charisma on and off the field. This assisted in the Jays first playoff series win in over 20 years over the Texas Rangers in the post season.</p>

			<p class="post-text">Flashback to the start of the 2016 season, Stroman was an unanimous decision to be the future ace of the Blue Jays, hence the starting position on the rotation. Stroman started off the month of April on a 3-0 start with a decent 4.37 ERA. As May began, the weather started to get better, but Stroman started to disintegrate. Stroman earned his first loss in May and went 2-1 with a 4.54 ERA. He started to show signs of inconsistency and lack of ability to control his pitches. As June started, many believed the Stroshow will begin to bounce back. That has yet to happen, as Stroman has gone on an unacceptable 1-3 with a 7.59 ERA this month. Everyone has to ask, where is the Stroshow? A 7.59 ERA for Marcus Stroman is far surpassed his potential. </p>

			<p class="post-text">The best decision now has to be sending Stroman to minor league duties/rehab. There's something wrong with the mechanics in Stromans pitching. Stromans ability to locate the strike zone is becoming inconsistent which is impacting his ability to go deep into the game. Sending Stroman down to the Bisons will be the ideal. But should Stroman feel ashamed for being demoted? Not at all. It's time for Marcus Stromam to fully find his inner callings and reestablish his charisma and ability to throw the fastball that we all fell in love with. </p>
