			<p class="post-text">The Toronto Raptors, who held the 9th pick in the 2016 NBA draft, are coming off a historic season. Not only did the Raptors reach the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time in the franchise’s 21 years, but they also achieved a team record of 56 wins. However, with great achievements, there are greater expectations; the Raptors are now pushing for a championship, next season. </p>

            <p class="post-text">With this sentiment, it is understandable why Masai was keeping his phone busy on draft day. According to many sources, Masai did have talks with multiple teams regarding the 9th pick, including a deal with OKC that involved star PF Serge Ibaka. Unfortunately to the dismay of Raptors fans, things did not pan out to add immediate production to the roster. So with no viable offers for the pick, the Raptors selected Austrian Native, Jakob Poeltl PF/C, from the University of Utah.</p>

            <h2 class="post-text">What you need to Know about Poeltl </h2>

            <p class="post-text">Standing 7’1’’ and 240 lbs., Poeltl is as big as basketball centers come. With great length and mobile feet, he doesn’t move like a traditional center. His ability to run the floor on transition, coupled with efficient big man scoring, has given him the reputation of a solid big man prospect, who is NBA ready. Here is a quick rundown on Poeltl:</p>

            <ul class="post-text">   
                <li>Projected top 5-10 pick</li>
                <li>PAC 12 player of the year (15-16)</li>
                <li>Recipient of the Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Award and Pete Newell Big Man Award as the top collegiate center and low-post player</li>
                <li>Averaged 17.2 pts, 9.1 rbd, 1.6 blks on .646 FG in his sophomore/final year
                Strengths: Mobile big man, efficient scoring, strong rebounding</li>
                <li>Weaknesses: Big man strength, limited versatility</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="post-text">Going Forward </h2>

            <p class="post-text">The Raps should now possess a winning mentality,  as they look to build off last season. If they want their team to reach that next level of achievement,  they need a player that can help them now and address their weakness at the 4. When analyzing their success, it is apparent that they went so far, due to their depth, with the likes of, Cory Joseph, Patrick Patterson and Bismack Biyombo all playing vital roles in their memorable postseason run. </p>

            <p class="post-text">Biyombo, who is likely to sign elsewhere considering he has a big payday coming his way, was a player who brought much needed rebounding and rim protection as a reliable backup.  I’ve read comments and articles online that address and discuss whether Poeltl will be able to fill those shoes as a reserve? Can he play the 4? Can he stretch the floor? However, it is important to establish that Bismack was truly, a diamond in the rough. </p>

            <h2 class="post-text" >Final Say</h2>

            <p class="post-text">Poeltl looks to have great fundamentals and basketball IQ. He has the size and mobility to become a solid defender and post player. In fact,  sources say he is even trying to develop an outside shot.  In a league that is getting smaller, a 7 foot PF may not be the best idea. However,  there is obvious potential that he will provide needed depth at the 5.  Depth is what will  add to the winning ways in Toronto. From watching interviews and highlights, it seems that Poeltl has a good head on his shoulders. Overall, it seems that he has the talent to have a lasting career in the NBA.
