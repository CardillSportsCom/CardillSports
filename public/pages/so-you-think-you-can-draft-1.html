            <p class="post-text">Ladies and Gentlemen of the fantasy NBA world, we are about to begin our research journey through the off-season, to prepare for next year’s bloodthirsty league that you will be fighting in.  You will need to prepare your weapons  by tracking the latest reports, rumors, trends, injuries and most important of all... a draft strategy.  If you do not have an effective draft strategy, your team will be dysfunctional, taking L’s on a weekly basis.  In that case, make sure to bring out your BBQ for your league’s draft party, for a roast session at your house.  So let me save you the embarrassment of avoiding fantasy NBA bottomfeeder for the rest of your life, and help you get on track with a few strategies to implement during the draft. </p>

            <p class="post-text">The majority of fantasy leagues use a head-to-head structured league, which is what my strategies will be based on.  In case you are not familiar with this strategy, it refers to rotating and facing a different player each week.  This is the best part of fantasy - a fresh new face to trash talk, for a fresh new week.  In a head-to-head league, there is no reason for you to try and win every category.  Since you need to win 5 out of the 9 categories, there is no need to unnecessarily chase after all 9 categories.  There is room to tank (or be “weak” ) in certain categories. This is what the punt strategy is all about.  In this article, we will be focusing specifically on punting (or “tanking”) the free throw percentage (FT%).</p>

            <p class="post-text">Players punting FT% are generally strong in FG% ,rebounds and blocks. However, they are only 3 categories that you can be strong in, out of the 9. Therefore, you must choose a couple of other categories to be strong in.  LeBron would be a viable option to draft , as he is weak in FT%, but here is a little secret I am going to share with you. You may think that Steph Curry, in this build is a bad idea, since he is the league leader in FT% at .908.  However, You are punting FT% for Shaq’s sake, why Curry? Think about it.  He is the most efficient guard at .504 FG%, and averages: 5.1 three pointers, 6.7 assists, 2.1 steals and surprisingly rebounds well for a guard his size at 5.4 rebounds.  In conclusion, a combo of Curry with DeAndre Jordan is pretty much deadly (unless you can steal Hassan Whiteside, in which your status is God level 9000).</p>

            <p class="post-text">Notice how I did not mention the points yet, and I left that out for a very good reason.  Points are a hard category to win with this build,  because your big men can destroy this category in a bad way.  Points is already a category for grabs on a weekly basis, so a points/FT% punt combo is recommended with this build.  Remember not to load up your top picks with big men.  Guards are a crucial part to this build, and elite guards are tough to come by, as the draft goes on.  The demand for guards is high, so remember to target them aggressively in early rounds.  Try keeping a balance of big-guard combos, so that you have 4 bigs and 4 guards by the end of the 8th Round. Use the table that I will provide on my next installment as a rough guide for this specific strategy, based on a standard 12-man league and ESPN/Yahoo’s rankings. In this chart, we are targeting FG%, assists, threes, steals and low turnovers,  all while keeping our points competitive.  The first round is very straightforward, but it is the later rounds that you will want to hear the juicy details on. So stay tuned, for my cheat sheet on this strategy!</p>
