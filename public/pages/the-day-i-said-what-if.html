                    Think about it. What if Carter stayed? What if McGrady stayed? Life as a Raptors fan would be a whole lot different. This ordinary run, that an ordinary playoff team such as the 2015-2016 Raptors are having would not have felt the same way as watching Rocky running through those Philli steps with a full blast of 1970’s techno. Boy that was a heart wrenching scene, but I digress. So what if Carter and McGrady stayed? Would the Raptors have won a championship with those two? Maybe. Maybe even multiple championships. But, the question is, would this year’s run have felt the same way if we did have a storied past such as the Lakers or Celtics? My immediate answer will be no. San Antonio has made the playoffs every year Tim Duncan has been in this league. If the fans had acted the same way Toronto treated the playoffs, there will definitely be much more heart attack casualties every year. What these Raptors are being treated to will not be seen in Boston or Los Angeles or San Antonio. This is why it was great that McGrady and Carter left. The bar has been set so low that a first round 7 game win against a 7th seed is cheered on like a championship. That’s what we get for being so bad for so long. Making the dumb and head scratching moves that this franchise has done has giving fans one thing. Always cheer for the small things. These 21 years have given the fans a chance to realize that even the smallest victory is a victory nonetheless. Be proud of the small wins, as the big wins are hopefully on the way. For example, we have no idea how the OKC Thunder fans will react once they start losing. Those guys are spoiled times infinity! They are loud and happy and always in good spirits. Will that continue even if they lose? A prime example that comes to mind are the Avalanche in the NHL. After moving from Quebec city, the Avalanche had a great 10 year run thanks to Sakic and Co. Once that era had retired, the franchise went into some dark years where the fan-base had no idea what they were watching since the only thing they have grown up to was winning. Anything else was seen as a lose, hence fan attraction decreased greatly.  That’s why it’s great that McGrady and Carter left. Yes, it would definitely be nice to see what those two would have brought to Toronto. But, for the long run, thanks for leaving guys. Toronto sports teams have the greatest fanbase in the world because we appreciate the small wins and milestones that our teams achieve. And I guess the teams just plain out sucked….
