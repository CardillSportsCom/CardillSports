            <h2 class="post-text">Game 7 Recap</h2>
 
			<p class="post-text">In a series full of blowouts, game 7 between the Warriors and Cavaliers was an instant classic. The Warriors started off strong with Draymond doing the best he could to make up for his Game 5 suspension by going on absolute fire in the first half (5-5 3pm, 22 points). It was a classic perimeter vs. paint gameas Cleveland was just 1-14 behind the arc with 28 of their 42 points coming within the inside. However, Golden State’s lead was kept close due to the Cavs dynamic duo of James (12 pts) and Irving (9 pts).</p>
			 
			<h2 class="post-text">First Half: CLE 42 GSW 49</h2>
			 
			<p class="post-text">The second half provided a thrilling back and forth affair with game 7 totalling 20 lead changes and 11 ties. As Cleveland’s stars started to heat up it seemed everyone on the Dubs besides Draymond was starting to fade (except Barnes, he’s been garbage the whole series). With the game tied at 89 with about 2:50 to play, this finals was actually coming down to the final minutes to crown the champs. At this point we see two crucial plays: Igoudala goes on transition for the easy two only to be met at the rim by the King himself who ferociously gets the key block where followed at the other end Kyrie is able to drain the decisive 3 pointer in isolation against curry (how fitting against Golden State). Up 92-89, Kevin Love is able to lock down Curry on the defensive end and a clutch free throw by LBJ puts the game away. The Cleveland Cavaliers are your 2016 NBA Champs.</p>
			 
			<h2 class="post-text">Final Score: CLE 93 GSW 89</h2>
			 
			<p class="post-text">It was the 19th game 7 in NBA finals history and the first time a team has come back from a 3-1 deficit in the finals. Not to mention it’s also been 52 long years for the city of Cleveland to see a major sports championship. King James is named your Finals MVP and he leads his teamto bring it home for “The Land”.</p>
			 
			<h2 class="post-text">Lebron James: Finals MVP</h2>
			 
			<p class="post-text">“I’m not promising a championship. I know how hard that is to deliver. We’re not ready right now. No way…Of course, I want to win next year, but I’m realistic. It will be a long process, much longer than it was in 2010.” James said at the time in 2014 where he announced that he’d be returning back to his hometown of Cleveland. Nevertheless, it took him the same 2 years to bring a championship. Down 3-1 in the series, Lebron led his Cavs with tremendous 41-point efforts in game 5 and 6 as well as becoming just the third player in history to triple-double in a game 7. LeBron proved once again how great he really is when everything is on the line. James is also the first player to ever lead a playoff series in points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks. In a series with the likes of all-stars Steph Curry, KlayThompson and DraymondGreen you really see how amazing this finals performance was.When you’re talking about the greatest player of our generation, leading the charge in a historic Finals comeback against arguably the greatest NBA team of all time doesn’t seem so impossible.</p>
