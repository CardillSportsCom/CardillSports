                <li>Good for Durant, because realistically if he were to chase a championship, GSW was the best place to go to. They already had ridiculous shooters like Curry and Thompson, and so adding  Durant to the mix just made them an NBA 2k team.</li>
                <li>This is the best move for Westbrook. He was never going to be second fiddle to Durant for the rest of his career. Looking at the way he plays, he has the mindset of a “I want to be a hero” player</li>
                <li>Adding another MVP player onto the team, could help to take off some of the load from Curry, in terms of pressure, in the playoffs.</li>

			<p class="post-text">Those were the only positives I took from this signing. In actuality, in terms of the quality of the NBA, I really hate this move. We've seen a trend of players transferring to other teams for a better chance at winning. However, I don't think I've ever seen a player switch to the very team, that came back and defeated them from being down 3-1. I love sports and I love seeing players/teams coming back from historic failures, upsets or downfalls and then triumph later on. The Boston Bruins were up 3-0 in a series and then eventually lost to the Flyers; while being up 3-0, in game 7. The next year, they came back and won the Stanley Cup. Ray Allen made a miracle 3 and Chris Bosh made the rebound of his life to avoid losing to the Spurs in game 6 of the 2013 finals; using that as motivation, the Spurs annihilated the Heat the next year, to win the 'chip. The Boston Red Sox came back from 3-0 against the Yankees and went on to win their first World Series Championship in 85 years, after years and years of heartbreak. Last year, the Toronto Blue Jays had to come back from being down 0-2 and pulled off a miracle 7th inning to defeat the Rangers in the ALDS. </p>    

            <p class="post-text">What I'm trying to say is that, through adversity, you make your mark and show that you are able to overcome odds and show what you've really made of. Durant is an amazing player, don't get me wrong, but, what irks me about this move is, you LOST against the Warriors in such a fashion that it's head scratching to say the least to understand why join them. I would have been fine if he went to  Boston, Miami, LA, or even New York, because that way he would have pushed those teams to an upper echelon and showed that by bringing his talents there, he could prove that he is an MVP, and top 3 player in the league. By going to the Warriors, he just proved what Jerry West was advising him to do during their meeting. He took the "easy way" out. Real champions and real talents don't take the easy way out. They toil for years to get the success that they deserve and want. </p>

            <p class="post-text"> This also makes me mad because with him leaving OKC, Westbrook is probably going to leave the Thunder next season as well. Players have always been shunned from playing in small markets that are not traditional "big markets. That’s why the Raptors always have trouble bringing players to their team, because too many players in the league view Toronto as just a nice City to play in, but not a City in line with LA or NYC.  No one would have went to OKC, if it weren't for Durant and Westbrook.  Now that Durant has left OKC, I doubt OKC will be able to keep Westbrook, because many teams will be in line to offer him bigger and better opportunities as well. OKC is an amazing sports town, Apparently they did a study and it said that their crowd is the loudest in the NBA. Now these fans are probably going to go through a rebuilding phase, but I really do hope Westbrook stays with the team.</p>

            <p class="post-text">In terms of NBA quality, this is what I don't like about the league;  If we were to compare the NBA to the NHL, MLB, NFL, or MLS, the amount of super teams in the NBA is too damn high. We know who's going to win or make it far each year in the NBA, because the majority of the big time players are going to join forces and pit against one another. For example,the cup finalists for the NHL this year were the Sharks and the Pens, which are two teams that definitely were not unanimously picked to go that far. It creates a sense of fairness to see that the unexpected can happen, stuff like an 8th place team winning a championship happens in the NHL (the LA kings did that in 2012). But that would never happen in the nba because the 8th place team is literally just lucky to be in the playoffs to begin with. </p>

            <p class="post-text">Upsets practically rarely happen in the NBA, because the parity in the NBA is so horrible. Yeah, it's cool that all these guys are joining together on a team to try to win a championship, but if you were to look back at NBA history before the Miami and Boston big 3, NO ONE joined together. Jordan was a ruthless competitor, he was friends with Bird, Magic, Barkley, etc, but he never was the type to bring in anyone because HE wanted to win by showing that HE was the best and HE was able to elevate those around him to better levels. Kobe never joined forces with anyone (though he did want to leave the Lakers at one point because they were so bad after Shaq left) but he still remained with the same team, Dirk never joined forces with anyone, Duncan as well. Think about this for a second, Mcgrady left the Raptors because he didn't want to play in the shadows of his much better cousin in Carter, if he had the mindset of current players, who knows where the Raptors would be today. </p>

            <p class="post-text">At this rate, it’s going to become 3 super teams, vs the rest of the league in the playoffs. Don't get me wrong, I’m happy Durant is probably going to win a championship next year with them, but it's sad that he has to join forces with an already capable team just to achieve what the rest have already achieved. It would have made sense to do something like this later on in your career when you have nothing left in your tank, similar to what guys like Richard Jefferson, Gary Payton, Jason Kidd, and Ray Allen did. </p>

            <p class="post-text">So good luck in Oakland Durant, but I hope my Raptors make a move soon so that they could possibly see you in the finals. </p>
