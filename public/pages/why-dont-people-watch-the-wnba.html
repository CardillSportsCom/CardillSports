            <p class="post-text">The WNBA is not without fans. With a viewership of 413,000, there is a large fan base invested in this league that truly enjoys watching these professional athletes play. I am personally not one of them, and I actually don’t know anyone who watches or follows the WNBA. I do, however, watch the NBA. And when comparing the NBA viewership of 1.46 million to a meagre 413,000, the WNBA seems like a joke. </p>

            <p class="post-text">To be fair, the NBA has been around 50 years longer than the WNBA - but the numbers are still mediocre, at best. It doesn’t seem likely that these numbers will increase any time soon. </p>

            <p class="post-text">When the WNBA was founded in 1996, many did not believe it would be sustainable. It wasn’t taken seriously and that remains the case today. But why? Why isn’t the WNBA more popular? Why don’t sports fans like to watch female professional athletes play? And why is the WNBA considered a joke when compared to the NBA?</p> 

            <p class="post-text">Before delving into these reasons, let’s first assume 2 things. First, I want to eliminate the idea that you are sexist if you have no interest in watching the WNBA. In some cases, this might be true, but for this article, we are assuming that is not the reason. Second, let’s assume that on a performance level, men on average outplay their female counterparts. I personally do not believe that every NBA player is better than the best WNBA players, but on average, NBA players do play better. Men play with more physicality and aggression. There is more dunking and scoring. The pace of the NBA games is much faster than WNBA games, which arguably makes it more exciting to watch. These reasons make the entertainment value of the NBA games much greater than those of the WNBA which could be why they are more popular. </p>
            
            <p class="post-text">So, is this how the NBA built a massive community of fans who dedicate their time to watching their games? The pure entertainment value is definitely a reason, but that cannot be the only one. It took so much more than that for the NBA to grow into the multibillion dollar industry it is today. It took 60 years to build the NBA community to where it is now, and this community is truly remarkable and something special. In addition to watching the performance of these athletes, people also tune in to watch the incredible storylines that the media narrates.</p>

            <p class="post-text">And that leads me to the main reason why the NBA is more popular than the WNBA – the amount of coverage it receives from the media.  </p>

            <p class="post-text">Everyone loves excitement, everyone loves a little drama and everyone loves getting invested in the lives of individuals they admire. This season, fans watched Kobe Bryant play his last game. They watched the underdogs, the Raptors, win 2 games against the Cavs when everyone said they would get swept. People watched to see which team would finally break Golden State’s winning streak. They tuned into watch LeBron finally win a championship for the Land. This season had many inspiring stories and these stories were everywhere because all of the major sports media outlets were covering them.</p>

            <p class="post-text">The media also reports on NBA stories that really aren’t newsworthy at all. One storyline that caught my attention was the buzz around LeBron James’ hairline. Sports journalists were so committed to this story that they even interviewed his barber! This community is so big and so dedicated to this sport that everything and anything about the NBA is interesting. </p>

            <p class="post-text">In contrast, where is the coverage on the WNBA? The media makes the argument that stories about the WNBA won’t get any ratings because people just don’t care about it. Compelling and newsworthy stories do exist in the WNBA, but these stories are missing in the media. Fans aren’t going to support players and teams if they don’t know anything about them. The argument that the WNBA is just not as exciting as the NBA doesn’t really make any sense. Real sports will always be entertaining and it will always be exciting to sports fans. </p>

            <p class="post-text">So maybe the real reason why the WNBA doesn’t get many viewers is because of how this league is portrayed in media. The NBA is broadcasted by several sports and news networks. However, many of these same networks don’t air or cover the WNBA games. If the media actually covered these games and wrote stories of these women’s talents to the world, maybe more people will begin to take an interest in the WNBA. </p>

            <p class="post-text">WNBA may not have much dunking or scoring compared to the NBA, but it still consists of intense competition, skill, strategy, and heart. This exists in all sports and that’s why people watch. When the media starts to take a bigger interest in the WNBA and the talent of its professional athletes, so will more women. So will more men. And so will the rest of the world. Without even realizing it, people might actually find themselves enjoying the WNBA.</p>
