                <p class="post-text">Dwight Howard was once a household name and now he is being overlooked, with teams focusing on other stars, such as Durant, Horford, etc. He was once a franchise player, as teams fought each other to try and reel him in. However, thinking in hindsight, it feels like that was ages ago.</p>

                <p class="post-text">Two things are clear: Dwight Howard’s legacy has come to an abrupt stop, and his name has been tarnished around the league. The future hall of famer Kobe called him “soft”, and even went as far as to tell him he could “teach him how to win”. Ouch. Talk about adding insult to injury. The way Howard responded to these remarks was priceless. He quickly packed his bags and left to Houston to create a dynamic duo with James Harden. However, after a couple of strong seasons where a WCF appearance was made in 2015, the team eventually imploded this season. Howard played a total of 71 games this season and it’s no secret that the two Houston stars have had their differences. Last season, Howard was plagued with injuries and only played 41 games. This forced James Harden to be the sole leader and as a result, was able to carry the team to the #2 seed in the west. This season, with a healthy Howard, they were barely able to secure the 8th seed. Is Howard the problem? Perhaps.</p>

                <h2 class="post-text">Howard’s Thoughts</h2>

                <p class="post-text">“I felt like my role was being reduced. I went to [Rockets general manager] Daryl [Morey] and said, 'I want to be more involved.' Daryl said, 'No, we don't want you to be.'”</p>

                <p class="post-text">"As a big, someone who has been the focal point of the team, who is still young, who still has some great years in front of me, you run the floor, you sprint as hard as you can, you duck in, and still, you don't get the ball. It brings you down. It sucks the energy out of you. I had long conversations with people close to me who said, 'Dwight, this is going to make you look bad. Don't keep doing this.'''</p>

                <p class="post-text">“My friends kept telling me, 'Even if you aren't getting shots, there are so many other things you can control while you are on the floor.' And they were right. I allowed not getting the ball to affect me. That's on me.”</p>

                <h2 class="post-text">Fresh Start</h2>

                <p class="post-text">Is Howard’s legacy over? Maybe it is, maybe it isn’t. But remember this, we are talking about the back-to-back-to-back defensive player of the year (2009, 2010, and 2011). Howard doesn’t need to score 20+ points, as he used to in his Orlando days. What he needs to do now, is be a dominant defensive threat that will make offensive players think twice before coming anywhere near the paint. He needs to be a beast, and play like he means it. He’s only 30 years old, his athleticism may not be what it used to be, but it hasn’t disappeared. He can easily average 1.5+ blocks/game and 10+ rebounds/game if he wanted to. And that is exactly the problem – “if he wanted to”. Many have questioned his lack of motivation and unwillingness to play hard. I am talking about a player that was used to superstar treatment, being the franchise player, and walked around with an inflated ego. His reluctance to accept the reality of him no longer being the franchise player, has hurt not only himself as a professional athlete, but the team’s success as well.</p>

                <p class="post-text">Is he a bad player? No, I believe he’s still a great player. But how he approaches the game is flawed. If he cannot mature and accept his role, Howard will not last long in the NBA. If Howard wants to be great again, and if he wants any chance at winning a ring, he must approach the game with the right attitude and accept his role as the defensive anchor of the team. A new beginning is not too late. The question is, does he want it?</p>
